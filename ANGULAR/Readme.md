# WELCOME TO ANGULAR COURSE


**What is Angular ?**

Angular is a **JavaScript Framework** which allows to create reactive **Single-Page-Applications(SPAs)**

**What is SPAs ?**

**Understanding Angular Versioning**

* AngularJS (Angular 1)

* Angular 10, 11, 12, .....
* Every 6 months new version will be realeased with minor upgrades, incremental, backwards-compatible changes

We create and develop Angular applications by using angular command line interface (angular CLI) with nodejs

**NodeJs** is a server side language 

We wont use nodejs anywhere in angular but we use in the backend purpose by the CLI to bundle and optimize our project and we will use npm, the Node Package Manager to manage different dependencies in angular project

**What is Angular CLI ?**

The Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that you use to initilize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications directly from a command shell

Install CLI by using npm package manager

```
npm install -g @angular/cli

```

Enter the following list commands or options for help descriptions

```
ng help
ng generate --help
```

Use Following commands to create, build and serve a new, basic angular project on a development server

```
ng new my-first-project
cd my-first-project
ng serve
```

In your browser, open [http://localhost:4200/]() to see the new application run. When you use the [ng serve](https://angular.io/cli/serve) command to build an application and serve it locally, the server automatically rebuilds the application and reloads the page when you change any of the source files.
