#### INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICS

A Statistic is a normally measured for a sample and not a population

- Difference between the different types of statistics
- Importance of statistical concepts in data science
- Applications of statistics in various business areas

Science of statistics and Statistical Methods are the essential tools in a data scientist's toolkit

**WHAT IS STATISTICS ?**

*we deals with a lot of data in our daily life - For example, in a newspaper, there can be data on the performace of athletes, Rainfall in different areas and more*

*Such data can be carefully studied to gain possible insights, especially when statkes associated with decisions are high*

*Data plays a key role in running businesses*

*Data is collected and maintained since time immemorial*

*Data was used in many areas to gain insight*

**"Statistics is the collection, presentation, analysis and interpretation of numerical data"**

**"Statistics deals with both non-numerical and attribute data"**

Ex : study of relative consumer preference of various brands

**"Statistics referes to quantitative data that is affected by multiplicity of causes"**

To illustrate multiplicity of causes, let us consider following examples

1. The yield of a crop is influenced by several factors such as the seed variety, soil fertility , qunatity and quality of manure
2. The time spent by a patient at a clinic is depends on several factors such as doctor's arrival, other patients and other consultation time

**WHY WE NEED STATISTICS AND IMPORTANCE OF STATISTICS**

Let us understand how statistics impacts our daily life.

1. Statistics helps in performing technical analysis of data
2. In most organizations, managers have to take several decisions that influence the performance periodically using the available quantitative and qualitative data

**QUANTITAIVE DATA**

**"Quantitative data can be logically analyzed by using dynamic statistical tools and techniques"**

Therefore there is a need for basic appreciation of such tools and techniques

Benefits of statistics

- Scope for clear and concise presentation of information or data - Data can be represented as graphs, charts or tables from which appropriate insights can be obtained
- Scope to make generalization on large data using samples - often large mass of items or units are relevant for a statistical investigation. It is uneconomical, time-consuming and tedious
  Ex : If a bank desires to improve the quality of customer service, it is impractical to contact every customer to collect their views or feedback

  Statistical theory provides logical methods to select samples and draw inferences based on the study of a sample
- Scope to make predictions or forecasts - If we consider the death rates in a particular region, a city or country, we can predict the future deaths
- Scope to make comparisons -In an organizationsl setting, it is invariably necessary to compare the performance of various machines, the profitability of various products etc.,

  Ex : Comparing the performance of two marketing campaigns

  Data of conversions from past campaigns can be statistically analyzed to find out the campaign that gives the best ROI

**DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POPULATION AND SAMPLE**

Population and sample are two popular widely used terms in statistics

**POPULATION or UNIVERSE**

"The set of all items under consideration, it is the enitre collection data"

**SAMPLE**

"A portion of the population is called sample"

Ex : Output of bulbs manufactured in a month

Entire output = population

Number of bulbs manufactured = sample

*STATISTICAL MEASURES*

""The characteristics of the population are studied based on the sample, specifically **parameter**"

**PARAMETER** - "A statistical measure that describes the character of the population is called a parameter **statistic"**

**STATISTIC** - "A statistical measure that describes the characteristic of the sample is called statistic"

In the example cited earlier :

Average life of all bulbs = parameter

Average life of the sample = statistic

**"The statistic is treated as an estimate of the parameter"**

**DIFFERENT TYPES OF STATISTICS**

- Statistical theory is broadly categorized into descriptive statistics, inferential statistics and predictive statistics

DISCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

- Descriptive statistics can be defined as those methods involving the collection, presentation and characterization of a set of data in order to describe its various features

INFERENTIAL STATISTICS

* Inferential statistics can be defined as those methods that enable the estimation of a characteristic of a population or making a decision concerning population based only on sample results

  NOTE :
* Population or Universe = The set of all items under consideration
* Sample = A portion of a population
* Parameter = A statistical measure that describes the characteristic of the population
* Statistic = A statistical method that describes the characteristic of the sample

  Ex: Automobiles manufactured in a month
* Entire o/p is considered as **population**
* The automobiles inspected for a quality characteristic like mileage per gallon of gasoline constitutes a **sample**
* The average mileage of all cars is a **parameter**
* The average life inspected sample is a **statistic**
* In this context, descriptive statistics deals with the selection of a sample, the presentation of sample data as disgrams or tables and computing the value of a statistic
* Inferential statistics answers questions such as : is the population average atleast 23 miles per gallon from the sample being studied ?

PREDICTIVE STATISTICS

* Predictive statistics can be defined as the science of extracting information from data and using them to predict trends, behavior patterns or relationships between characteristics

  Ex: The data on the number residents in a city recorded over the years could be used to predict the city's future population
* This could be useful to predict the estimation for the demand of infrastructure for city's future population
* Sometimes data on two or more characteristics can exhibit some relationships such data can be used to predict values of one characteristic knowing the values of the others

  Ex:
* (Demand Prediction) the sales of cars during past few years can be used to predict the demand for spares in the forthcoming years
* Similarly, (Prediction based on performance) the performance of candidates in selection tests can be used to predict the job performance scores


**IMPORTANCE OF STATISTICAL CONCEPTS IN DATA SCIENCE**

*Why statistics is need or useful for data science ?*

The easy availability of large valumes of data with vast scope for retrieval, communication and analysis has led to the emergence of scientific approaches to capitalize on their power specifically the branch of data science

*What is Data Science ?*

- Data science is a vast field that combines practices from multiple disciplines majorly from statistics to make sense of data
- It uses well-known and understood scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and derive insights from data
- The data may be structured or unstructured - Using data science, we apply knowledgeable and actionable insights from data across a broad range of applications
- Today businesses store a wide range of data - The primary reasons are technological advances, such as big data and the internet of things (IOT) , data storage, retrieval and transimission hardware are increasingly cheaper
- Therefor msaking sense of 2.5 quintillion bytes of data that humans are generating every day is essential foe business success

  Ex: [Managing Intensive Care Units (ICU) ] consider the issue of managing deficit capacity in ICU - this problem that confronts hospital administrators and health care professionals has been studied using data science
- Discharged patients are readmitted when the severity level of risk is high
- More readmissions impose constraints on ICU capacity
- policies for discharge were created based on study the data on demand, severity and likelihood of readmission helped to create policies for discharge
- Specifically, patients with a low likelihood of readmission are recommended for discharge by incorporating **demand from incoming patients** and **improving level of security** will helps to improve service quality and yet reduced the problem of deficit capacity

  Analyzing the used approach in the above example
- First sight, the approach is **intutive** and easy to propose the **methodolgy is powerful** as relaevant data are used and the degree of **interelationships between factors** is logically incorporated
- Significant improvement with inclusion of more factors and complex interrelations need to be incorporated factors such as likelihood of readmission are statistical in nature
- Even after systematically assessing the severity, the need for readmission is uncertain
- Several factors are impacted by randomness and uncertainty
- Demand and supply are typical business factors that involve uncertainty. Therefore statisctics is very useful for such cases
