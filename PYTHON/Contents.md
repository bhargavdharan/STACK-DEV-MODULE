## INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON PROGRAMMING

Python is a simple, general-purpose, high-level and object 0riented programming language

Python is easy to understand language which feels like reading simple english

Python is an interpreted scripting languge also. "**Guido Van Rossum**" is known as founder of Python Programming.

Python was invented by "Guido Van Rossum" in 1991 at CWI in netherland.The idea of python programming language has taken from the ABC language or we can say ABC is a predecessor of python language

**FACT BEHIND CHOOSING NAME PYTHON -** Guido Van Rossum was a fan of the popular BBC comedy show of that time, "**Monty Python's Flying Circus**".so he decided to pick the name for this newly created programming language

> Ans : ***Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level, and interpreted programming language.it supports object oriented programming approach to develop applications. it is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures***

> ***Python is easy to learn yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it attractive for application development***

> ***Python's syntax and dynamic typing with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development***

> ***Python supports multiple programming pattern, including object-oriented, imperative and functionsal or procedural programming styles***

> ***Python is not inteded to work in a particular area, such as web programming. That is why is known as multipurpose programming because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D CAD etc.,***

> ***We don't need to use data type to declare variable because it is dynamically typed so we can write a = 10 to assign an integer value in an integer variable***
>
> ***Python nakes the development and debugging fast because there is no compilation step included in Python development and edit test-debug cycle is very fast***

### Features in Python

Python Provides many useful features to the programmer. These features make it most popular and widely used language. So listed below are essential feature of python

* **SImple and Easy to use**
  - Python is easy to learn as compared to othre programming languages. its syntax is straighforward and much the same as the english language. there is no use of semivolon or curly-braket, the indentation defines the code block. it is recommended programming language
* **Expressive Language**
  * Python can perform complex tasks using few lines of code.A simple example, the hello world program you simply type print("Hello World").it will take only one line to execute, while java or c takes multiple times
* **Interpreted Language**
  * Python is an integrated language, it means the pytho program is executed one line at a time. THe advantage of being interpreted language, it makes debugging easy and portable
* **Free and Open-Source Language**
  * Python is freely available for everyone. it is freely available on its official website www.python.org.it has a large community across the world and dedicated working towards make new modules and functions
* **Cross-Platform Language**
  * Python can run equally on different platforms such as windows, Linux, Unix, Macintosh, etc., So we can say that python is a portable language. it enables programmers to develop the software for several competing platforms by writing a program only once
* **Object-Oriented Language**
  * Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come into existence. it supports inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation, etc., the object-oriented procedure helps programmer to write reusable code and develop applications in less code
* [**Extensible**]()
  * It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to compile the code and thus it can be further in our python code. it converts the program into byte code, and any platform can use that byte code
* **Learn Standard Library**
* **GUI Programming Support**
  * Graphical User Interface is used for the developing desktop applications. PyQT5, Tkinter, kivy are the libraries which are used for the application
* **Dynamic Memory Allocation**
  * In python, we dont need to specify the data-type of the variable
* **Integrated**
* **Embeddable**
* **Dynamic Memory Allocation**
* **Wide range of libraries and frameworks**

## Tips to Keep in Mind While Learning Python

The most common question asked by the beginners - **"What is the best way to learn Python"?** It is the initial and relevant question because first step in learning any programming language is to know how to learn.

The proper way of learning will help us to learn fast and become a good Python developer.

1. Make it clear why we want to learn
2. Learn the basic syntax
3. Keep practicing
4. Make Notes as needed
5. Discuss concepts with others
6. Do Small Projects
7. Teach others
8. Explore libraries and frameworks
9. contribute to open source


# Python Program

We will discuss the basic syntax of Python, we will run a simple program to print **Hello World** on the console.

Python provides us the two ways to run a program:

* Using Interactive interpreter prompt
* Using a script file

Let's discuss each one of them in detail.

## Interactive interpreter prompt

[Python](https://www.javatpoint.com/python-tutorial) provides us the feature to execute the Python statement one by one at the interactive prompt. It is preferable in the case where we are concerned about the output of each line of our [Python program](https://www.javatpoint.com/python-programs).

To open the interactive mode, open the terminal (or command prompt) and type python (python3 in case if you have Python2 and Python3 both installed on your system).

After writing the print statement, press the **Enter** key.

It will open the following prompt where we can execute the Python statement and check their impact on the console.

Here, we get the message **"Hello World !"** printed on the console.

## Using a script file (Script Mode Programming)

The interpreter prompt is best to run the single-line statements of the code. However, we cannot write the code every-time on the terminal. It is not suitable to write multiple lines of code.

Using the script mode, we can write multiple lines code into a file which can be executed later. For this purpose, we need to open an editor like notepad, create a file named and save it with **.py** extension, which stands for **"Python".** Now, we will implement the above example using the script mode.

To run this file named as first.py, we need to run the following command on the terminal

**Step - 1:** Open the Python interactive shell, and click **"File"** then choose **"New",** it will open a new blank script in which we can write our code.

**Step -2:** Now, write the code and press **"Ctrl+S"** to save the file.

**Step - 3:** After saving the code, we can run it by clicking "Run" or "Run Module". It will display the output to the shell.

**Step - 4:** Apart from that, we can also run the file using the operating system terminal. But, we should be aware of the path of the directory where we have saved our file.

* Open the command line prompt and navigate to the directory.
* We need to type the **python** keyword, followed by the file name and hit enter to run the Python file.


## Multi-line Statements

Multi-line statements are written into the notepad like an editor and saved it with **.py** extension. In the following example, we have defined the execution of the multiple code lines using the Python script.

```
name = "Bhargav"
branch = "Computer Science"
age = "21"
print("My name is : ",name)
print("My age is : ",age)
```
