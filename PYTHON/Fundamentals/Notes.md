### MODULES

A module is a file containing code written by someone else which can be imported and used in our programs

**PIP**  -  It is the package manager for python. you can use pip to install a module on your system

**Types of Modules**

There are two types of modules in python.

1. Build in modules - pre-installed in python
2. External modules - Need to install using pip

### COMMENTS

Comments are used to write something the programmer does not want to execute

Types of comments

There are two types of comments in python

1. Single-Line Comments  - written using #comment
2. Multi-line Comments - written using "comment"

### VARIABLE

A variable is the name given to a memory location in a program or A variable is container to store values

Example

a = 143 b = "Love" c = 90.3

where a,b,c are the variables that store respective data

**Rules of Defining a variable name**

* A variable name contains alphabets, digits, underscores.
* A variable name can only start with alphabet or with an underscore.
* A variable name can't start with a digit
* No whitespaces is allowed to be used-inside a variable name

### IDENTIFIERS

An identifier can denote various entities like variable type, subroutines, labels, functions, packges and so on

Example

a = "Deepak Kumar"

where, a is an identifier or a variable

### KEYWORD

Reserved words in the are known as keywords. They can't be used as variable names as their meaning is already reserved

Code to sell all keywords

`Import keyword #we learn about import fn later

print(keyword.kwlist)`

### DATA TYPES

Python is the Dynamic typed language that automatically identifies the type of data for us

Primarily , below are the following data types in python

1. Integers
2. Floating-point numbers
3. String
4. Boolean
5. None

**Integer and Floating-point numbers**

Integers and floating-points are separated by the presence or absence of a decimal point

For instance, 5 is an integer whereas 5.0 is a floating point number

**String**

* Strings are array of bytes representing unicode characters
* A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote or triple quote
* In python there is no character data type, a character is a string of length 1 and it is represented by the "str" class

**Boolean**

It is used to store two values i.e, TRUE or FALSE. it is used to test whether the result of an expression is TRUE or FALSE

**None**

It is used to define a null variable

### OPERATORS

Operator is a symbol that performs certain operations

Example : a + b

a, b are the operands and + is an operator

There are seven operations in python

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Assignment and Compound Assignment Operators
3. Comparison Operators
4. Logical Operators
5. Bitwise Operators
6. Identity Operators
7. Membership Operators

**Operator Precedence**

If multiple operators present then which operator will be evaluated first is decided by operator
